CHESS BOARD POINT CALCULATIONS

    - Main idea of the algorithm for calculation:
        1) Iterate every piece of the board
        2) According to piece type, run the calculation method
        3) Check squares that piece can move
        4) If there is any enemy piece in piece's way, set the enemy piece's point to half
        5) Do not set again that enemy piece's point
        6) Finally, add white pieces point and black pieces point
   
Technology:
    - I used Java language and Intellij IDEA editor for this project. 
    - The project is object-oriented and modular

Running
    - Program start run in main method in the Main class.
    - Program reads 3 different input files
    - Main class can be edited according to different file numbers or file names.
